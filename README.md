# Mujin Webstack Client Cpp

This is the client for webstack, in C++.

We also have a [python version](https://github.com/mujin/mujinwebstackclientpy).

## Building?

You can try to `cmake`, but as of this commit, it's probably difficult since there's some dependencies that aren't on github.

We'll get there.
